Magic telescope data set.
This data set was created by MC (Monte Carlo ) simulations for the registration of high energy gamma particles by atmospheric 1 gamma telescope. The features of the dataset are pulses created by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes of the telescope. Depending on the received energy, the primary gamma, several Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas signal from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays (class: signal) or background signal found in the upper atmosphere (class: background)
